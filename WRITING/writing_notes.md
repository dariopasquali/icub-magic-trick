How to relate Novelty Effect to Lie Detection

Novelty is usually used during investigation to asses if a withness is telleing the truth or not.
The reaction to a stimulus, for example the photo of an arrested subject in a set of photos of innocent people, can be used to identify if the witness is telling the truth or not.

The main point of the reserach is to understand if is possibile to use the PONE effect in uncontrolled scenario. The presence of the robot is a step forward in the direction of a future where robots will be part of our society. If the PONE effect can be seen in general ecological scenario, we could port it into a robot and use it to support decision for example in healtcare, law enforcement or teaching.

A common scenario is the identifiation of guilty people, PONE to assess if the identificator is telling the truth. Even better in combination with the tool of jonas

The main point is the low number of data and the really really ucontrolled scenario. The idea is to start from here to define a better experiment with more subjects and a better design.

What to review in the literature:
* Different tyes of memory
* Novelty effect respect to Old effect
* Pupil Old New Effect
* What happens when we involve the memory recall cognitive load? because this is what happens in the relevant case, the subject use is memory to recognize the previously seen object...so what is expected to be different in the subject's behaviour???
* Cases where the old/new effect is relevant (investigations, ....)

* Pupil Diameter is not controllable (Clark, W. R., & Johnson, D. A. (1970). Effects of instructional set on pupillary responses during a short- term memory task. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 85(2), 315-317.)


* Write the mean pupil diameter during all the experiment
