#### A Systems Approach to Countermeasures in Credibility Assessment Interviews:
* Mean pupil dilation is much grater when a guilty subject see the target object in the foil (a slide of 4 objects with the taerget, 5 slides in total, so 1 target over 20 images). Each foil presented for 5 seconds
  
* How can you extrapolate the target data when it is in the middle of other images???
  
* The enviroment is really not ecological!

#### Keeping an Eye on the Truth? Pupil size changes associated with recognition memory
* **More dilation when subject see the OLD item respect to the NEW items**
* They use words (old and new) in a really controller scenario
* Refer to the baseline with division to calculate a Pupil Dilation Rate from the Maximum Pupil Dilation
* The main point is that the effect is still present when the subject give a wrong answer by choice

#### EFFECTS OF INSTRUCTIONAL SET ON PUPILLARY RESPONSES DURING A SHORT-TERM MEMORY TASK
* PD increases as material is stored (NEW) and decreases when material is recalled (OLD)
* Compare when they don't know nothing about the experiment and when they know the measures and the purpose of the experiment.
* Old methods to measure pupils
* Why a Subject should countermeasure the experiment???
* **No differenct between the conditions**

#### Safe and sensible preprocessing and baseline correction of pupil-size data Sebastiaan
* Use subtractive refer to baseline and a lot of other useful suggestions

#### Revisiting the Novelty Effect: When Familiarity, Not Novelty, Enhances Memory
* Minions can also lead to a Familiarity effect!! Similar but different to short-term effect
* Non si capisce un cazzo, hanno usato tipo dei proverbi ma niente pupille
* inutile


#### The coupling of emotion and cognition in the eye: Introducing the pupil old/new effect
* Correlation of emotional reaction an PONE. We have the same problem since the cards are not "Neutral" but some of them could trigger emotional reaction (like hedge)
* Practically they have old and new words, and emotional words. The PD is lower with old words and with emotional words
