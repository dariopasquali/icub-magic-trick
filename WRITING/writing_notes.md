How to relate Novelty Effect to Lie Detection

Novelty is usually used during investigation to asses if a withness is telleing the truth or not.
The reaction to a stimulus, for example the photo of an arrested subject in a set of photos of innocent people, can be used to identify if the witness is telling the truth or not.

What to review in the literature:
* Novelty effect respect to Old effect
* Pupil Old New Effect
* What happens when we involve the memory recall cognitive load? because this is what happens in the relevant case, the subject use is memory to recognize the previously seen object...so what is expected to be different in the subject's behaviour???
* Cases where the old/new effect is relevant (investigations, ....)

* Pupil Diameter is not controllable (Clark, W. R., & Johnson, D. A. (1970). Effects of instructional set on pupillary responses during a short- term memory task. Journal of Experimental Psychology, 85(2), 315-317.)
