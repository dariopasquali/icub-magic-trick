#### A Systems Approach to Countermeasures in Credibility Assessment Interviews:
* Mean pupil dilation is much grater when a guilty subject see the target object in the foil (a slide of 4 objects with the taerget, 5 slides in total, so 1 target over 20 images). Each foil presented for 5 seconds
  
* How can you extrapolate the target data when it is in the middle of other images???
  
* The enviroment is really not ecological!

#### Keeping an Eye on the Truth? Pupil size changes associated with recognition memory
* **More dilation when subject see the OLD item respect to the NEW items**
* They use words (old and new) in a really controller scenario
* Refer to the baseline with division to calculate a Pupil Dilation Rate from the Maximum Pupil Dilation
* The main point is that the effect is still present when the subject give a wrong answer by choice

#### EFFECTS OF INSTRUCTIONAL SET ON PUPILLARY RESPONSES DURING A SHORT-TERM MEMORY TASK
* PD increases as material is stored (NEW) and decreases when material is recalled (OLD)
* Compare when they don't know nothing about the experiment and when they know the measures and the purpose of the experiment.
* Old methods to measure pupils
* Why a Subject should countermeasure the experiment???
* **No differenct between the conditions**

#### Safe and sensible preprocessing and baseline correction of pupil-size data Sebastiaan
* Use subtractive refer to baseline and a lot of other useful suggestions

#### Revisiting the Novelty Effect: When Familiarity, Not Novelty, Enhances Memory
* Minions can also lead to a Familiarity effect!! Similar but different to short-term effect
* Non si capisce un cazzo, hanno usato tipo dei proverbi ma niente pupille
* inutile


#### The coupling of emotion and cognition in the eye: Introducing the pupil old/new effect
* Correlation of emotional reaction an PONE. We have the same problem since the cards are not "Neutral" but some of them could trigger emotional reaction (like hedge)
* Practically they have old and new words, and emotional words (poisitive, negative, neutral). The PD is lower with old words and with emotional words
* They found that with OLD card the mean pupil dilation is higher
* Moreover is higer for negative and positive respetct to neutral (this behaviour is swapped for the NEW card)

#### Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society
* Recognition of famous and non famous faces
* Eye Features
  * **SIGNIFICANT! Fixation duration (mean)** (The duration of a fixation indicates how long the local information in a display was processed, which includes the duration necessary to program the subsequent saccade.) The fact to have more fixation in the Target could be because the recognition itself requires more fixations than the recognition of a nonTarget...it's easier to exclude an object as unknown that to be sure that the object is something we already know
  
  * **Saccade Amplitude (mean)** (measuring the length of saccades in degrees of visual angle. Short saccades can indicate fine-grained processing of local information, whereas long saccades often signify low information content or superficial scanning of local visual input.)
  
  * **Relative (divisive) pupil size**

* They also explored the effect in short response window. In particular they used a **percentage of the duration** (25% before the end) and found that in that window the pupil dilation is greater for OLD respect to NEW objects -> **Better than define a priori 1 second**.
  * The idea is that the moment of recognizing a famous face has an impact on the eye-movement data. In an earlier, unpublished study on a face search experiment, we observed that the moment of recognizing the presence of a face tended to coincide with a prolonged fixation and temporarily dilated pupils. If such a reaction also occurs at the moment of recognizing a known face, then in the present study this would not only explain the greater in pupil size, but also the longer fixations measured for famous as compared to non-famous faces.
  * The moment of recognition is most likely to occur during **the last 25% of a trial**, so if we found the recognizability effects on fixation duration and pupil size to only occur during the last phase, as indicated by an interaction of the factors recognizability and time interval, it would support the moment of recognition interpretation.


#### Psychophysiological Indices of Recognition Memorys
* To have the PONE effect is not (in general) required to SEE, but in our context is required because the stimulus is visual
* It's a thesis, it provides A LOT OF INFORMATION
* Mean pupil diameter is 2.6 mm
* Task-evoked change after 400 ms post-stimuli
* pupil dilation is an index of cognitive load
* From page 69 Stuff about Memory and recognition (Diana, Reder, Arndt, & Park, 2006; Dunn, 2004; Macmillan, & Rotello, 2006; Malmberg, Holden, & Shiffrin, 2004; Murdock, 2006; Park, Reder, & Dickison, 2005; Parks, & Yonelinas, 2007; Rotello, Macmillan, & Reeder, 2004; Tulving, 1985b; Wixted, 2007b; Wixted, & Stretch, 2004; Yonelinas, 2002)
* Page 88, a so fucking USEFUL table with references for eye-size in relation of Recognition Memory
* Main findings
  * the PONE occurs in a standard explicit test of recognition memory but not in “implicit” tests of either perceptual fluency or artificial grammar learning;
  * the PONE is present even when participants are asked to give false behavioural answers in a malingering task, or are asked not to respond at all;
  * the PONE is present when attention is divided both at learning and during recognition;
  * the PONE is accompanied by a posterior ERP old/new effect;
  * the PONE does not occur when participants are asked to read previously encountered words without making a recognition decision;
  * the PONE does not occur if participants preload an “old/new” response; 
  * the PONE is not enhanced by repetition during learning.

#### Lie Detection Frontiers
* Beatty et al. (2000) identified three useful task-evoked pupillary responses (TEPRs): mean pupil dilation, peak dilation, and latency to the peak.
* In the end it makes clear the errors and the limitation of the approch, basically copy and paste them
